  "description": "My focus is improving bitcoin privacy. Right now I'm developing a [CoinSwap implemention](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964), aiming to massively improve bitcoin's privacy and fungibility beyond anything seen before. I invented [JoinMarket](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/JoinMarket), the first widely-used Equal-Output CoinJoin implementation. I also focus on education and writing for the [bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Special:Contributions/Belcher) including the extensive [Privacy wiki page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy). I also created [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), aiming to be the easiest and most-efficent way to connect your Electrum wallet to your own full node, and in this way improving the user's privacy and security.",
