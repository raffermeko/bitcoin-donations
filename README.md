# Bitcoin Donation Portal

## Support bitcoin developers so they can focus on building our future

[The website](https://bitcoindevlist.com/) lists people working on Bitcoin and related projects.
We want to increase the visibility of contributors to the space that are accepting donations.
Donations help funding their work and provide support for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Adding yourself to the lists

If you are involved in the space yourself you can [get yourself added](https://github.com/dennisreimann/bitcoin-donations/edit/master/data.js).
Just append your block of data to the bottom, the list is shuffled on page load.
You can use Markdown in the `description` property.
